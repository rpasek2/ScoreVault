## Database Schema

### SQLite (Local Storage)

**gymnasts**
- id, name, dateOfBirth, usagNumber, level, discipline, createdAt

**meets**
- id, name, date, season, location, createdAt

**scores**
- id, meetId, gymnastId, level
- Event scores: vault, bars, beam, floor (Women's) / floor, pommelHorse, rings, vault, parallelBars, highBar (Men's)
- allAround (calculated)
- Placements for each event
- createdAt

### Firestore (Cloud Backup Only)

**backups/{userId}**
- Complete JSON backup of all local data
- Timestamp and device ID
- Restore capability

## Data Management

### Export Formats
- **JSON**: Complete backup, can be re-imported
- **CSV**: Spreadsheet format for external analysis (read-only)

### Import Requirements
- Only JSON format supported
- Must include `gymnasts`, `meets`, and `scores` arrays
- See `IMPORT_EXPORT_GUIDE.md` for detailed format specifications

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Local-First?
- **Offline Access**: Works without internet connection
- **Speed**: Instant data access, no network latency
- **Cost**: No per-read/write Firebase costs
- **Privacy**: Data stays on device by default

### Why Optional Cloud Backup?
- **Safety**: Protect against data loss
- **Multi-Device**: Access data on multiple devices
- **Flexibility**: Users choose when to backup
- **Cost Control**: Only backup when needed

## Season Calculation

Gymnastics seasons run August through July:
- **Aug-Dec**: Season is "YYYY-(YYYY+1)"
- **Jan-July**: Season is "(YYYY-1)-YYYY"
- Example: September 2025 â†’ "2025-2026", March 2026 â†’ "2025-2026"
